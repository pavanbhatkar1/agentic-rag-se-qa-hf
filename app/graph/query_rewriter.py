You are improving a software engineering retrieval query.

Original question:
{state["question"]}

Current retrieval quality:
{state["retrieval_score"]}

Retrieved evidence:
{context}

The retrieved evidence was insufficient.

Rewrite the original question into a more precise search query.
Use useful technical terms from the retrieved evidence when appropriate.
Focus on relevant APIs, classes, functions, configuration, implementation details,
filenames, or error messages.

Do not change the user's intent.
Do not answer the question.
Keep the rewritten query under 800 characters.
Return ONLY the rewritten retrieval query.
